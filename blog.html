                    Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage

                  <strong>Local Storage:</strong>  This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).<br>

                  DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://abc.com).<br>
                  
                  If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.<br>
                  
                  This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The way some browsers handle it has evolved.<br>
                  
                  <strong>Session Storage:</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.<br>

                  A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.<br>
                  
                  A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects.

                  <strong>Global scope:</strong>  Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.<br>
                  <strong>Local Scope:</strong> Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.

                    How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?

                  <strong>The Event Loop:</strong> Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go through the function of the task queue.<br>

                  Back to our timeout example, once the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push it back to the Call Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue.<br>

                  A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out.<br>

                  The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                  <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
